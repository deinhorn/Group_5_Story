Pierre the pear, has no hair.
He spends his life trying not be eaten at the county fair.
While Carrie the Carrot goes through life without a care.
Because no one likes veggies, so she just chills in her chair.
Pierre the pear was having a grand ole day then saw April the Apple across the way.
Pierre thought it was love at first sight.
Until April pushed him toward a 5 year old around lunch time.
